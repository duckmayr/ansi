Description: ANSI escape codes are character sequences that terminal emulators
    the R console recognize as specifying the color or style of text printed
    to the console. This intentionally lightweight package provides a simple
    interface to use some of this functionality, namely causing text to be a
    different color, boldfaced, italicized, and/or underlined.
